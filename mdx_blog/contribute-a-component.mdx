We will review the process of contributing a component to the UI kit. We hope you become a contributor! We are always looking for new contributors. Remember this is an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and learn something new. This is also an opportunity to get involved in the open source community. Finally, this is an opportunity to contribute something that will be used by the community.

Note: This is a living document. We will be updating this page as we go.

Note for product owners and project managers: Contributors will be working on components as part of their sprint commitments however they should not be contributing if there is a deadline, product request, or other impediment (executive decision) associated with the component. WPDS is a place where we can take our time to get it right the first time.

## Design

## Code

If you are interested in contributing as an engineer to the UI kit, please follow the steps below.

1. Review the components on our [roadmap](/roadmap). The components are listed in the order of priority. Find a component that is not already assigned to a contributor(s). The components already have design & code specs along with a JIRA ticket. Please review them with your team before you start.

If you are not sure, please ask a question on [our community Slack channel](https://washpost.slack.com/archives/C01FWHF12BG).

2. Now that you have reviewed the specs and the JIRA ticket, please reach out to the Core team on [our Slack channel](https://washpost.slack.com/archives/C01FWHF12BG). We're review the specs and the JIRA ticket and will assign the ticket to you.

3. You are now ready to start contributing. Review the [component design](/blog/component-design) blog post for how we design components. Now that you have reviewed our component design architecture, open the codebase up and review the contributing guidelines. We have a simple way to stub out a new component using some boilerplate code (`npm run new-component <component-name>`).

4. Once you're in a good spot for rubber duck session, reach out to a fellow team mate. We want you to get the most out of the UI kit. This is a great opportunity to learn and grow from others who might not be familiar with the UI kit. This is not a place for a formal code review. This is a safe space for you to receive feedback and ask questions.

5. Once you're happy with your work, please submit a pull request to the [UI kit repo](https://github.com/WPMedia/wpds-ui-kit). Please include a link to your JIRA ticket. The core team and contributors will be notified and will review your pull request.

6. Once your pull request is approved, we will begin the documentation process with you. As a contributor you will be responsible for the documentation process. Please review the [component documentation](/blog/component-documentation) blog post for how we document components.

7. Now the component has been documented. The component is ready to be shipped. Please review the [releases](/blog/releases) blog post for how we release components. We will be releasing new components on a monthly basis.

8. Our new component is live to the world! You are expected to commit to two weeks of support and triage. Please review the support process [here](/blog/support-process).

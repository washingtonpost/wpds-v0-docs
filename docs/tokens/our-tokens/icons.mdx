All of our icons are defined by a single svg path and are constrained to icon sizes `16px` `24px` `32px`
Our icons communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention to important information. We
categorize some our icons Wayfinding, Media controls and Social that have a guidance around their use.
